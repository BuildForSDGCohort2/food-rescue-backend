# nest-home-for-the-needy

## Description

This is the Typescript version of my nodejs rest API backend that I am building for an IDP Camp Management Software (Which will be useful both for mobile, web and desktop frontends). I name it after 'Home For The Needy IDP Camp' here in Benin City Nigeria where I intend to first donate the software as my contribution to help the Displaced Persons there. Subsequently I should make it available for as many IDP Camps and refugee camps as possible in the world.Here I use the Nestjs framework, being that it is a battle-tested typescript framework.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

Some app credential files have been 'gitignored on purpose', hence, you MAY need my assistance to get this api up and running. Feel free to contact me.

## Running the app

After setting up the app credentials with or without my assistance, do these:

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
